# game-installations
This repo is where I put my game installations, download them if you want.

All my games are trustworthy because they are made using Unity.

# how to install:
1. Go in a folder of the game of your choice.

Example: game-installations/squarethon/

2. Go in the folder of your operating system.

Example: game-installations/squarethon/windows/

3. Go in the version you want to install.

Example: game-installations/squarethon/windows/Release Win 1.0
